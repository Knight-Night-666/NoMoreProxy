## NO MORE PROXY
Its the project made by team ERROR 404 for hackathon HACKNITR 3.0.
Idea of our project is to use face recognition technology to mark the attendence of students for the classes in the college. We store all the details of the students of the college in the database and then maintain all the courses and student enrolled in that course. Details include Name, Roll No., Courses enrolled and a reference image for the the facial recognition to compare against.

While marking attendence, a photo will be snapped which will be tested against reference images in the database. If system recognizes the face of the student, it will mark attendence in attendence database.

Technologies used:

- OpenCv
- MySQL
- Flask
- Javascript

As of now, the front end and back end have not been linked as the front end is still in progress.

Main file for backend : facial.py
