## NO MORE PROXY
Its the project made by team ERROR 404 for hackathon HACKNITR 3.0.
Idea of our project is to use face recognition technology to mark the attendence of students for the classes in the college. We store all the details of the students of the college in the database and then maintain all the courses and student enrolled in that course. If system recognizes the face of the student, it will mark attendence in attendence database.

Technologies used:

- OpenCv
- MySQL
- Flask
- Javascript
